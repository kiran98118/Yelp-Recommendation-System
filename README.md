# 🍽️ Restaurant Recommendation System

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Restaurant Recommendation System** aims to leverage the large Yelp dataset to recommend restaurants based on user preferences, reviews, and business attributes. With the increasing demand for dining experiences, this system seeks to analyze user evaluations and offer personalized suggestions to help users make informed dining choices while offering insights for restaurant owners to improve their business.

This system uses **Big Data** technologies to process large amounts of data from Yelp’s open dataset and builds a recommendation model based on user evaluations, business hours, food quality, service, and more.

## 📋 Features

- **User-centric Recommendations**: Recommend restaurants based on user preferences (e.g., food quality, service).
- **Data Analysis**: Analyze user reviews to extract useful information about what attracts customers.
- **Scalable & Efficient**: Built with Big Data technologies to handle large datasets efficiently.
- **Restaurant Insights**: Provide business owners with insights into their restaurant’s strengths and areas for improvement.
- **Advanced Algorithms**: Uses collaborative filtering and content-based filtering techniques for personalized recommendations.

## 🗃️ Dataset Description

The project utilizes **Yelp’s Open Dataset**, which includes:

- **4.7 million user reviews**
- **150,000 business profiles**
- **200,000 images**
- **1.2 million business attributes**, including:
  - Business hours
  - Parking availability
  - Reservation options
  - Customer ratings and more
- **1 million user tips** from **1.1 million users**

This dataset provides a comprehensive sample to implement restaurant recommendations using user-generated content and business attributes.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Big Data Frameworks**: Apache **Hadoop**, **Spark** for large-scale data processing.
- **Distributed Storage**: **HBase**, **Cassandra** for storing large datasets.
- **Data Processing**: **MapReduce**, **Spark SQL** for data analysis and transformation.
- **Recommendation Algorithms**: Collaborative Filtering, Content-Based Filtering.
- **Web Frameworks**: **Flask** or **Django** for the backend API.
- **Frontend**: **React.js** for a user-friendly interface.
- **Data Visualization**: **Tableau**, **D3.js** for generating visual insights.

## 🏗️ Architecture

- **Data Collection**: The system extracts data from the Yelp dataset and processes it using Spark.
- **Recommendation Engine**: The engine analyzes reviews and business data to build the user's mental model and recommend restaurants.
- **Backend API**: A Flask/Django-based API serves the recommendations to the frontend.
- **Frontend**: A React.js web application displays recommendations and restaurant details.
